# Arduino-Multi-Input-Output-Device
Check out the README FILE for an explanation of what this does.  

This Codes does the following things for an Arduino Device. 

Reads the light sensor value from lightpin and maps it to a brightness value for the LED using analogWrite.

Reads the flex sensor value from flexpin and maps it to a position for the servo motor using servo1.write.

Reads the touch sensor value from touchme and maps it to a speed value for the motor using analogWrite.

Reads the potentiometer value from PotatoPin and maps it to a frequency value for the piezo speaker using the tone function.
